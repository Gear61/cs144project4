Q1: For which communication(s) do you use the SSL encryption? If you are encrypting the communication from (1) to (2) in Figure 2, for example, write (1)→(2) in your answer.

We use SSL encryption for (4)->(5), since only this communication include the user’s credit card information.

Q2: How do you ensure that the item was purchased exactly at the Buy_Price of that particular item?

We associate all item information with the HTTP session upon the loading of an item’s information page, so all of it is encapsulated from the user.

Q3: How do you guarantee that the user cannot scroll horizontally?

Q4: How do you guarantee that the width of your textbox component(s) can fit the screen width of a mobile device? Note: you have to explain "how", and you can't simply state that "we use a XXX downloaded from YYY, and it magically solve the problem."
